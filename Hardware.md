## Q: This is all very cool but you guys do not have a Plug&Play for my Trabant. I think I will go and make a new rusEFI board just for my Trabant

A: At rusEFI we love cool new projects, but we are a really small team and only have so much time to work on rusEFI.  
We already have lots of different hardware configurations and we would suggest using one of the existing wire in versions.  
Nobody is stopping you from making your own board, but we cannot guarantee any support for that board or assistance with building it.  
If you proceed then please consider making a P&P adapter board design based on [Hellen](Hellen-One-Platform), [Proteus](https://github.com/mck1117/proteus/), or microRusEFI. See also https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/Custom-Firmware

## Q: What EDA are you guys using for your open source hardware?

A: rusEFI preference KiCad. A few legacy pieces are still using KiCad 4 and 5. While many EDAs have many cool features KiCad gives rusEFI uniformity and consistency.

## Q: What pin do I use for tachometer output?

A: There is no single right answer. It really depends on what kind of electrical signal is your tachometer expecting. Is it low-side driven? +5v logic signal driven? +12v logic signal driven?

## Q: What are these four status LEDs close to main processor?

A: Many rusEFI boards have four status LEDs. All four LEDs blink on start-up just to confirm life.

Blue Communication LED which is expected to blink at 50% duty cycle during normal board operation.
If USB communication cable is connected Blue LED starts to blink faster.

Red CRITICAL (previously known as FATAL) error means you have a CRITICAL error, engine operation is not possible with CRITICAL error.

Green LED on many rusEFI boards is RUNNING. Off if engine is stopped, blinks if engine is cranking, solid if engine is running.

## Q: Exiting, what soldering iron is best?

A: [FAQ Why No Self Assembly](FAQ-Why-No-Self-Assembly)

## Q: Why battery holder?

A: So that log file names could be current time stamp. That functionality is the only reason for battery holder.

## Q: I would like to fabricate and sell on my country

A: See [Royalty](Royalty)

## Q: how do I make my own board?

A: [Hellen One Platform](Hellen-One-Platform) is a way to build an ECU from existing functional blocks like knock detection module or wideband controller module.
